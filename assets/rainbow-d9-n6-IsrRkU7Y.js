const markdown$15 = "### Error handling\n\nError handling is a critical part of any step. It is important to handle errors properly to ensure that your step is robust\nand reliable. `@rainbow-o23` provided a standard exception handling process, including the following four types of exceptions:\n\n- `CatchableError`: Catchable exception. Generally refers to exceptions thrown in pipeline steps expected to be caught and handled\n  externally,\n- `ExposedUncathableError`: Uncatchable exception which identified as exposed. Generally refers to exceptions thrown in pipeline steps not\n  expected to be handled additionally externally, and should be exposed to the caller,\n- `UncatchableError`: Uncatchable exception. Generally refers to exceptions thrown in pipeline steps not expected to be handled additionally\n  externally,\n- `AnyError`: Any exception. Generally refers to any exception thrown in pipeline steps.\n\nIt is important to note that exception handling is mutually exclusive. If an exception has already been caught by a handler, it will not be\ncaught by any other handlers. After throwing an exception, the pipeline steps will detect exception type in the above order. As long as the\nexception matches the catch type and the processor for that catch type has been defined, the defined processing logic will be entered. In\npractical scenarios, exception catching needs to be done according to requirements. Generally, there are some recommended practices:\n\n- Generally, `CatchableError` is expected to be caught and handled. For whether the pipeline step will throw this exception, please refer to\n  the corresponding step documentation,\n- In most pipeline steps, since custom snippet can be used to define logic (in addition to the step itself, can use snippet to\n  define the logic for `pick from input` and `write to output`), any type of exception can be thrown in these snippets, so whether or not\n  you need to catch it depends on the specific definition of the custom snippet for this step,\n- Generally speaking, `ExposedUncatchableError` and `UncatchableError` do not require further processing,\n- Also, can use `AnyError` to catch all types of exceptions, including `Node.js` standard exceptions\n\n`@rainbow-o23` provides two ways to handle exceptions, which will be demonstrated below.\n\n#### Using snippet\n\nUse snippet processing for handling error. The following parameters can be used during the error handling process:\n\n- `$code`: Error code. Note that it is always `O01-99999` when using the `AnyError` handler.\n- `$error`: Error object itself,\n- `$factor`: The content portion of the request data, excluding context data,\n- `$request`: The entire request data, including both content and context,\n- `$helpers` or `$`: Data manipulation helpers.\n\n> All handlers are async functions, so `await` is available inside.\n\nAfter handling the exception in the snippet, can either return normally, rethrow the original exception, or construct and throw a new\nexception. The following examples will provide some references:\n\n```ts\n// simply log the exception.\n$.$logger.error(`An exception[code=${$code}] caught.`, $error);\n\n// return normally\nreturn 'Everything is OK now.';\n\n// or check exception type, decide to rethrow or construct a new exception\nif ($.$errors.isCatchable($error)) {\n	// construct and throw a new exception\n	$.$errors.exposed({status: 500, code: $code, reason: $error.message});\n} else {\n	// rethrow the original exception\n	throw $error;\n}\n```\n\n> In most cases, special exception handling is not necessary, as `@rainbow-o23` will handle all exceptions consistently when returning to\n> the API caller.\n\n> When choosing to return normally, meaning no exception is thrown anymore, the returned data will go through the `write to output` process\n> and will be consistent with the normal logic of returning data in the pipeline steps. However, if an exception is thrown during\n> the `write to output` process, this exception will be thrown directly, no error handling on this situation.\n\nHere are some commonly used utility function examples for exception handling in `$helpers`. For detailed specifications, please refer to\nthe `@rainbow-o23` documentation.\n\n```ts\n// log exception\n$.$logger.log(`An exception[code=${$code}] caught.`, $error);\n$.$logger.warn(`An exception[code=${$code}] caught.`, $error);\n// If the log function has two or more parameters, and the last one is a string, then the last parameter will be used as the log category\n$.$logger.error(`An exception[code=${$code}] caught.`, $error, 'SomeLogCategory');\n\n// check error type\n// note exposed uncatchable error is also an uncatchable error\n// so if want to check exposed uncatchable error, should check it first\n$.$errors.isCatchable($error);       // check it is a catchable error\n$.$errors.isExposed($error);         // check it is an exposed uncatchable error\n$.$errors.isUncatchable($error);     // check it is an uncatchable error\n\n// construct a new error and rethrow it\n// for catchable\n$.$errors.catchable({code: $code, reason: 'I am catchable.'});\n// for exposed uncatchable, a status field is required\n// status is exactly following the HTTP status code, code is the error code, reason is the error message\n$.$error({status: 500, code: $code, reason: 'Unpredicated error occurred.'});\n$.$errors.exposed({status: 500, code: $code, reason: 'Unpredicated error occurred.'});\n// for uncatchable\n$.$errors.uncatchable({code: $code, reason: 'I am uncatchable.'});\n```\n\n#### Using sub-steps\n\nIn practice, if an exception requires additional handling and is not thrown after processing, it is recommended to configure this using\npipeline steps. When choosing to handle exceptions using pipeline steps, the format of the request data received by the step is as follows\n\n```ts\ninterface Data {\n	$code: string;        // error code \n	$error: Error;        // error itself \n	$factor: any;         // original factor data, return by the pick from input process\n	$request: any;        // original request data, with both input data and pipeline context\n}\n```\n\n";
const markdown$14 = "Handle `ExposedUncatchableError` thrown by current step. The following parameters can be used during the error handling process:\n\n- `$code`: Error code. Note that it is always `O01-99999` when using the `AnyError` handler.\n- `$error`: Error object itself,\n- `$factor`: The content portion of the request data, excluding context data,\n- `$request`: The entire request data, including both content and context,\n- `$helpers` or `$`: Data manipulation helpers.\n\n> It is an async function, so `await` is available inside.\n";

If no data is returned, there is no input data for this step.\n\n> It is a sync function, so `await` is not available inside.\n";
const markdown$12 = "### Input and output\n\nUsually, when processing logic, we do not need all the memory contexts, but only need to extract certain fragments for processing and return\nthe processing results to the context for subsequent logic to continue processing. Therefore, `@rainbow-o23` provides a relevant\nimplementation, allowing pipeline steps to flexibly access the relevant memory data and write back the processed result data to the context\nin the required format.\n\n#### Pick from input\n\nUse the `Pick from input` property to define a JavaScript script. The returned data will be used as input data for this step. The script is\na function that takes the following parameters:\n\n- `$factor` represents the incoming data,\n- `$request` represents the original request data (including incoming data and a context), it is not recommended,\n- `$helpers` represents function supporting, and it has a shortcut `$`.\n\nHere is a simple example:\n\n```ts\n// incoming data\nconst incoming = {name: 'John', age: 23};\n\n// Only the age is needed as a parameter in the step processing, not the name.\n// Define a transformation script, so in the actual processing logic of the current step, only the age will be collected, and there won't be a field for the name attribute.\nreturn {age: $factor.age};\n```\n\n> `return` is not necessary. If the script is only one line (and has no line breaks), the system will consider the result of executing that\n> line as the result of the entire function.\n\n> It's important to note that whether modifications to memory data during processing will affect the original input data depends on how the\n> transformation is handled. Generally, if deep cloning is not performed, it will affect the data; otherwise, it will not.\n\n#### Write to output\n\nUse the `Write to output` property to define a script. The returned data will be used as output data for this step. The script is a function\nthat takes the following parameters:\n\n- `$result` represents the outgoing data,\n- `$request` represents the original request data (including incoming data and a context), it is not recommended,\n- `$helpers` represents function supporting, and it has a shortcut `$`.\n\nHere is a simple example:\n\n```ts\n// outgoing data\nconst outgoing = {name: 'John', age: 23};\n\n// The result data should only include age, not the name.\n// Define a transformation script, the age alone will be stored in memory for subsequent use.\nreturn {age: $result.age};\n```\n\n> `return` is not necessary. If the script is only one line (and has no line breaks), the system will consider the result of executing that\n> line as the result of the entire function.\n\n>\n\n#### Merge-back Strategy\n\nAfter processing the step logic and obtaining the returned data, you can also define how this returned data should be merged into the\ncontext of the entire pipeline. There are several ways to define this, all declared using the `Merge-back strategy` attribute:\n\n- Defined as `Replace`, it means the returned data will overwrite the original context and be used as the new context.\n- Defined as `Unbox and merge`, it means the returned data will be automatically unboxed and merged into the original context. In this\n  case, the returned data must be a JSON object and cannot be a primitive type or an array.\n- Defined as `As specific property`, it means the returned data will be merged into the original context under the specified name.\n\nHere is a simple example:\n\n```ts\n// context data\nlet context = {name: 'John', age: 0};\nconst result = {age: 23};\n\n// merge not defined, equivalent to\ncontext = result;\n// context is {age: 23}\n\n// merge is \"unbox and merge\", equivalent to\ncontext = {...context, ...result};\n// context is {name: 'John', age: 23}\n\n// merge is 'person', equivalent to\ncontext = {...context, person: result};\n// context is {name: 'John', age: 0, person: {age: 23}}\n```\n\n> Note that in the latter two cases, there is a possibility of name collision resulting in the original context being overwritten.\n> Therefore, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of the data structure in the context.\n\n#### Keep or clear\n\nIn the following `Write to output` scenarios, and in cases where merge-back strategy is specified as `Replace`:\n\n- Returning `null` or `undefined` (recommended to use `(void 0)` to represent `undefined`) indicates that the original request data will\n  continue to be used as the request data for the next step without any modifications.\n- Returning a flag created by `$helpers.$clearContextData()` to clear context data will be used as the request data for the next step, while\n  all other data is cleared.\n\n> Please note that \"without any modifications\" is a conceptual reference. If the data has already been altered by the logic executed in the\n> step, the data passed to the next step may not be identical to the input data of this step.\n";

const markdown$n = "## Overview\n\nThe core concept of `@rainbow-o23` is pipeline, where all logic is defined through pipeline and its steps. There are three different forms\nof\npipeline based on how it is defined:\n\n- Pipeline, which can optionally be exposed as an API. To differentiate, we generally refer to pipelines that are exposed as\n  APIs as `Pipeline as API`, and pipelines that are not exposed as APIs as `pipeline`. In all documents, we will use\n  this name to refer to it. If not specifically labeled as `as API`, it means that this pipeline has not been exposed as an API.\n- Step set, composed of a group of steps,\n- Step: based on the definition of a single step.\n\nIf defined as a pipeline and is exposed as an API, it does not allow other pipeline steps to call it, otherwise it does. Therefore, if\ncertain logic combinations can be reused, they should be defined as a pipeline/steps set/step.\n\n## Common attributes\n\nAll definitions should have the following attributes:\n\n- A `code` attribute for identification within the system, so the value of the `code` attribute is globally unique.\n- A `type` attribute is used to indicate the type of this definition, and the value of the `type` attribute must be one\n  of `pipeline`, `step-sets`, or `step`.\n- An `enabled` attribute is used to indicate whether this definition is effective, and the value of the `enabled` attribute must be\n  either `true` or `false`. If not defined, this definition is considered to be effective by default.\n\n## Pipeline as API\n\nIf the definition contains a `route` attribute and specifies a URI, it is considered to be published as an API. A pipeline published\nas an API includes all standard HTTP protocol elements:\n\n- `route`, URI of API. Excluding the scheme, domain name, and port in the URL, the application configuration can also specify the path\n  context,\n	- To facilitate the definition and parsing of data contained in the `route`, you can use `pathParams` for definition. `pathParams` can\n	  be a list of parameters, or you can use `true` to define receiving all valid path parameters. Please note that the definition of path\n	  parameters must conform to the [nestjs](https://docs.nestjs.com/controllers#route-parameters) standard.\n- `method`, supporting `get`, `post`, `put`, `patch`, and `delete`,\n- `headers`, a list of headers that need to be parsed, or `true` to parse all headers,\n- `queryParams`, a list of query parameters that need to be parsed, or `true` to parse all query parameters,\n- `body`, the content of the HTTP body is in JSON format. To better adapt to common practices of HTTP API usage:\n	- When `method` is specified as `get` and the `body` parameter is not explicitly set to `true`, the system defaults to ignoring the HTTP\n	  body content,\n	- When `method` is not specified as `get` and the `body` parameter is not explicitly set to `false`, the system defaults to parsing the\n	  HTTP body content,\n- `files`, a list of files that need to be parsed, or `true` to parse all files.\n\nThere are also some HTTP response definitions:\n\n- `exposeHeaders`, a set of headers that need to be pushed to the client,\n- `exposeFile`, indicating whether the response data is a file.\n\n## Pipeline\n\nIf the definition does not contain a `route` attribute, it is considered a pipeline. A pipeline can be called by other pipeline steps.\n\nA pipeline always includes at least one step, and its behavior is entirely determined by the steps defined within it.\n\nA pipeline also has a special property `initOnly`, which if declared as `true`, indicates that this pipeline will only be\nexecuted when the application starts, and the application will not provide any parameters during execution.\n\n## Step set\n\nStep set, as the name suggests, can define a set of steps. They can also define how their built-in steps are executed, typically in the\nfollowing ways:\n\n- Synchronous serial,\n- Asynchronous serial,\n- Synchronous parallel,\n- Conditional execution,\n- Loop execution (only for input data as an array),\n- Start a database transaction.\n\nBy combining the various types of step collections mentioned above, you can construct execution sequences suitable for different scenarios.\n\n## Step\n\nSteps can be any type of step definition, including step sets. Logically, a step set is a step which includes a set of sub steps, and\ndifferent step sets define the way their sub steps are executed. Steps are implemented by different standard step components for\ndifferent purposes. Here are some built-in standard steps:\n\n- Retrieve values from models or remove attributes,\n- Execute snippets,\n- Generate snowflake IDs,\n- Call predefined pipelines or steps,\n- Make remote HTTP API calls,\n- Read from or write to databases.\n\nAdditionally, you can also obtain the following steps support through the `@rainbow-o23` standard extension library:\n\n- Print PDF, Word, Excel, CSV,\n- Manipulate AWS S3 objects.\n\n> The latest step support can be found on [Github](https://github.com/InsureMO/rainbow-o23).\n";

If using dynamic environment variables for specification,\nyou need to indicate the key of the environment variable, such as key `db.default` corresponding to the `CFG_DB_DEFAULT` environment\nvariable name.\n\n#### Transaction\n\nTypeORM steps use transaction names to identify transactions, steps can be grouped under a transaction. If transaction is declared as\nautonomous, the step will be executed in the default transaction (autonomous transaction). Essentially, steps within a transaction should be\nnested in a TypeORM transactional step and have the same transaction name.\n\n> Transactional steps can be nested, meaning a transactional step can contain another transactional step as a sub-step, even if they have\n> different transaction names.\n\n#### Native SQL Support & Enhancement\n\nSQL supports native database syntax. At the same time, `@rainbow-o23` enhances SQL syntax, allowing the use of the `$property` syntax to\nretrieve corresponding data from data objects, also supports multi-level property names, connected by `.`. For example, `$person.name`\nrepresents that `person` is an object and `name` is a property under `person`. The following are the supported syntax features:\n\n- `IN ($...names)`: `one-of`, `names` should be an array,\n- `LIKE $name%`: `starts-with`,\n- `LIKE $%name`: `ends-with`,\n- `LIKE $%name%`: `contains`.\n\n> Name mapping is case-sensitive.  \n> `LIKE` is case-sensitive.\n\nSince different databases have varying degrees of support for dialects, `@rainbow-o23` also provides appropriate enhanced support for this:\n\n- For pagination, `$.limit($offset, $limit)` will be translated and executed in the appropriate dialect. For example,\n	- `MySQL` uses `LIMIT $offset, $limit`,\n	- `PostgreSQL` uses `OFFSET $offset LIMIT $limit`.\n	- `MSSQL` and `Oracle` use `OFFSET $offset ROWS FETCH NEXT $limit ROWS ONLY`,\n		- `MSSQL` requires an `ORDER BY` clause for pagination SQL. If there is no `ORDER BY` clause, will\n		  use `ORDER BY 1 OFFSET $offset ROWS FETCH NEXT $limit ROWS ONLY`.\n- For JSON column, because some databases (such as MSSQL) do not have a JSON column type, they cannot automatically replace strings in the\n  result set with JSON objects,\n	- Use `config as "config.@json"` to explicitly indicate that the `config` column is of JSON data type.\n	- Use `$config.@json` to explicitly indicate that the `config` property of given parameters is of JSON data type.\n- For boolean column which use numeric(int/smallint/tinyint) as storage type, because some databases (such as PostgreSQL) cannot\n  automatically convert boolean values in memory to numeric 0 or 1 in the database,\n	- Use `enabled as "enabled.@bool"` to explicitly indicate that the `enabled` column is of boolean in-memory and numeric in database data\n	  type.\n	- Use `$enabled.@bool` to explicitly indicate that the `enabled` property of given parameters is of boolean in-memory and numeric in\n	  database data type.\n- For datetime (MySQL, MSSQL) / timestamp (Oracle, PostgreSQL) column,\n	- Use `created_at as "createdAt.@ts"` to explicitly indicate that the `createdAt` column is of string in-memory and timestamp in\n	  database data type.\n	- Use `$createdAt.@ts` to explicitly indicate that the `createdAt` property of given parameters is of string in-memory and timestamp in\n	  database data type.\n\n> It is recommended that if you need to consider support for multiple database dialects, using enhanced syntax will make it easier to write\n> SQL. If you only need to support a specific database, then using its standard syntax is sufficient.\n\n> It is important to note that some databases (such as `PostgreSQL`) do not differentiate column names by case. This can affect the property\n> names of the returned objects in the result set (usually recommended in camel case). Therefore, even though it is not a syntax\n> enhancement, it is strongly recommended to use aliases to standardize the column names in the returned result set, for\n> example, `PERSON_NAME AS "personName"`, please pay attention to the use of quotation marks to correctly preserve the case.\n\n- When given data is an array, provide SQL written using standard binding variable placeholders (sequence numbers),\n	- `MySQL` uses `?`,\n	- `PostgreSQL` uses `$1`, `$2`, ...,\n	- `MSSQL` uses `@0`, `@1`, ...,\n	- `Oracle` uses `:0`, `:1`, ...,\n- When given data is a record, provide SQL written using named binding variable placeholders.\n';
