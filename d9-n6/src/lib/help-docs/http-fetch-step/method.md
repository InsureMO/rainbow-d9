HTTP methods are generally defined as `POST` and `GET`. Other commonly used methods include `PUT`, `DELETE`, and `PATCH`. However, `OPTIONS`
is typically reserved for standard purposes and is generally not recommended for actual data communication. For a comprehensive list of HTTP
methods, you can refer to the [MDN HTTP request methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods).
