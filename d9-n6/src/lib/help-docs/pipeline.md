  format to another format. It is used to clean the data and to perform some operations on the data. It is used to load the data into the
  destination.
- **Model Pipeline**: This pipeline is used to train the model on the data. It is used to test the model on the data. It is used to evaluate
  the model on the data. It is used to deploy the model on the data.
- **Deployment Pipeline**: This pipeline is used to deploy the model on the data. It is used to monitor the model on the data. It is used to
  retrain the model on the data. It is used to update the model on the data.
